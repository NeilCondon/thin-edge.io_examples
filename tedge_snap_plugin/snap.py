Exit status
The exit status of plugins are interpreted by agent as follows:

0: success.
1: usage. The command arguments cannot be interpreted, and the command has not been launched.
2: failure. The command failed and there is no point to retry.
3: retry. The command failed but might be successful later (for instance, when the network will be back).

Assumptions:
* Device has installed and configured `snap`.
* thin-edge.io is deployed on the device and configured.

    The most basic command supported by sm plugins is `list` command.
    Command is used to recognise plugin as well as to list current list of software packages installed using this plugin.
    For `snap` the following interface could be used: `snap list` as per https://snapcraft.io/docs/getting-started.
    The agent expects the plugin to return the list as `tab (\t)` separated values on stdout.

    API spec: https://thin-edge.github.io/thin-edge.io-specs/software-management/plugin-api.html#the-list-command

    Another important capability of a plugin is `install` command.
    Plugin API defines that the command should take 1 parameter and support 2 optional:
    `name` -> name of the package to be installed
    `--version` -> to specify which version of the package should be installed
    `--file` -> allows to use downloaded files if remote location to be used

    https://thin-edge.github.io/thin-edge.io-specs/software-management/plugin-api.html#the-install-command

    `snap` supports automatic version selection from the channel, meaning that in our basic implementation we will just use the `name` of the package.
